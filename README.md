# ML & Neural Networks  
by Nina Mizrahi  

## Overview  
This repository is a curated collection of machine–learning and neural‑network focused experiments, models, and tutorial notebooks. My intention with these artifacts is to demonstrate how I translate theoretical foundations (from my Computational Neuroscience background) into practical code, implementable pipelines, and reproducible workflows.

As a recent graduate in Computational Neuroscience with strong interests in AI/ML engineering, the work here bridges statistical modelling, deep learning architectures, and coding best practices to show readiness for industry roles.

## What’s Inside  
- Multiple Jupyter Notebook and/or Python script files that walk through core ML and NN concepts (e.g., model architecture, training loop, evaluation metrics, hyperparameter tuning).  
- Examples of neural network implementations: perhaps feed‑forward neural nets, convolutional nets, recurrent nets, or custom architectures (adjust according to your files).  
- Projects showing full workflow: data loading/pre‑processing → model definition → training → evaluation → visualization of results.  
- Clean documentation and versioning: each experiment is organised to be understandable, reproducible and accessible by a reviewer/recruiter.

## Highlighted Skills  
- **Neural Network Architecture & Implementation** — ability to design, code and train neural networks from scratch or using frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).  
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals** — solid grasp of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, classification/regression tasks, evaluation metrics, overfitting/regularization.  
- **Software Engineering Practices for ML** — notebooks and scripts follow modular, clean‑code style, include comments/documentation, track experiments reproducibly (via version control).  
- **Data Science Workflow** — from raw dataset ingest through preprocessing, feature transformation, model training, to result interpretation and visualisation.  
- **Computational Neuroscience Exposure** — given your background, you bring a domain‑aware perspective (e.g., encoding models, neural dynamics) which enriches your ML/NN work and shows ability to handle domain‑specific ML problems.
